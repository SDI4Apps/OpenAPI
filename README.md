# SDI4Apps OpenAPI Custom Web Services

The SDI4Apps OpenAPI is a set of web services exposed by the SDI4Apps Cloud platform that enable HTML5/JavaScript clients to access advanced geospatial processing capabilities from the simplicity of client-side programming languages.

The Open API consists partly of the protocols exposed by the components in the platform, i.e. Open Geospatial Consortium compliant web services like WMS, WFS and CS-W. Other parts of the API implements custom functionality that adds specific search/processing capabilities to the system. The code of these custom services are included in this repository.

The code base of the project has been ported to this repository in the last week based on the content of two independent previous repositories where the actual development has taken place.
